// A local validator on a busy machine (seen in WSL) sometimes stalls for several seconds. A
// transaction signed with a fresh blockhash can then fail its preflight with "Blockhash not found"
// although nothing is wrong with it, and the tests after it fail as a knock-on. A transaction that
// fails preflight is never forwarded, so sending the same signed transaction again a moment later
// is safe. This file makes the Connection that Anchor uses retry that one error, up to five times.
// It loads before the other test files (the name sorts first) and changes nothing else.
